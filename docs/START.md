# 🚀 FactTrack 2.0 - START HERE

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS READY!

**Status**: Cleaned, Fixed, and Ready to Run

---

## 🎯 THE FIX

**Problem**: PyTorch 2.6+ security change blocked model loading

**Solution**: Added `weights_only=False` to model loading code

**Status**: ✅ FIXED in both model files

---

## 🧹 CLEANUP DONE

Removed **14 duplicate/unnecessary files**:
- Old sklearn models (4 files)
- Redundant documentation (10 files)

**Result**: Clean, professional codebase

---

## 🚀 RUN THIS COMMAND

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**
