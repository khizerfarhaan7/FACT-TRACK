# üîß PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility Fix Applied

## ‚úÖ ERROR FIXED!

I've identified and fixed the error you were seeing.

---

## üêõ THE PROBLEM

**Error Message:**
```
Weights only load failed... Please use weights_only=False
```

**What Happened:**
- You installed PyTorch 2.6+ (latest version)
- PyTorch 2.6 changed `torch.load()` default behavior for security
- Old default: `weights_only=False` (allows all Python objects)
- New default: `weights_only=True` (security restriction)
- Our models need `weights_only=False` to load

**Why It Happened:**
PyTorch made this change for security reasons, but it breaks loading of models that contain numpy objects.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX

I've updated both model files to add `weights_only=False`:

**Fixed in `modules/bert_bias_model.py`:**
```python
# Line 441 - OLD:
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=config.DEVICE)

# Line 441 - NEW:
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=config.DEVICE, weights_only=False)
```

**Fixed in `modules/bert_category_model.py`:**
```python
# Line 347 - OLD:
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=config.DEVICE)

# Line 347 - NEW:
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path, map_location=config.DEVICE, weights_only=False)
```

---

## üöÄ WHAT TO DO NOW

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Code (Recommended)

The fix is already in your files. Now just:

```bash
# You already have the data, so just retrain with fixed code
python train.py
```

This will train the models with the NEW code that can load properly.

---

### Option 2: Use Existing Models (If You Don't Want to Retrain)

If you already trained models and don't want to wait for retraining:

```bash
# Just run the app - it will now work with the fix
python app.py
```

The app will now load the models correctly because we added `weights_only=False`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHY THE APP KEPT SAYING "TRAIN THE MODELS"

**Reason**: The bias model couldn't load due to the PyTorch compatibility issue, so the app thought the models weren't trained yet.

**Now Fixed**: The models will load correctly!

---

## üéØ EXACT NEXT STEPS

### If You Already Ran `python download_data.py`:

```bash
# Just retrain with the fixed code (30min-4hrs)
python train.py
```

### If You Already Trained Models:

```bash
# The fix allows loading, so just restart the app
python app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

**You should now see:**
```
‚úì Category classifier loaded
‚úì Bias detector loaded          ‚Üê This should work now!
‚úì All models loaded successfully!
```

---

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION

### After running `python app.py`, you should see:

**SUCCESS:**
```
============================================================
Loading FactTrack BERT Models...
============================================================

1. Loading category classifier...
   ‚úì Category classifier loaded

2. Loading bias detector...
   ‚úì Bias detector loaded           ‚Üê No more error here!

============================================================
‚úì All models loaded successfully!
  Device: cpu
  Categories: 20
  Version: 2.0.0
============================================================

üåê Access the application at: http://localhost:5000
```

**NOT THIS (error):**
```
‚úó Error loading models: Weights only load failed...
```

---

## üîç IF YOU STILL SEE ERRORS

### Check if models were trained:

```powershell
# Check if these files exist
dir models\category_bert\model.pt
dir models\bias_bert\model.pt
```

**If files DON'T exist:**
- You need to train: `python train.py`

**If files DO exist but still error:**
- The models were trained with old code
- Delete and retrain:
```powershell
rmdir /s models
python train.py
```

---

## üéØ SUMMARY

**The Issue**: PyTorch 2.6+ security change broke model loading

**The Fix**: Added `weights_only=False` to both model files

**Next Step**: 
- If you have trained models: `python app.py` (will now work!)
- If not: `python train.py` then `python app.py`

---

## üí° WHY IT KEPT ASKING TO RETRAIN

The app checks if models load successfully. When the bias model failed to load (due to PyTorch compatibility), it thought you hadn't trained yet, so it kept showing:

```
Please follow these steps:
  1. python download_data.py  
  2. python train.py          ‚Üê Kept asking for this
  3. python app.py
```

Now with the fix, the models will load correctly!

---

**Try running `python app.py` again now. It should work!** ‚úÖ

If models aren't trained yet, run `python train.py` once with the fixed code.

---

*Fix applied in: bert_bias_model.py and bert_category_model.py*
