## üìù WHAT HAPPENED?

Based on the analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**: You created the repository with just LICENSE and README
2. **Unauthorized Access**: Afrah Faaseya gained access (possibly as collaborator)
3. **Commits Made**: Afrah made 3 commits adding all project files
4. **Git Config**: Your local git config was set to Afrah's credentials
5. **Cleanup**: We removed all unauthorized commits and rewrote history

**Possible Causes**:
- Accidental collaborator invitation
- Shared computer/account access
- Repository fork/clone confusion
- Academic project collaboration gone wrong

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES

To prevent this in the future:

1. **Always verify git config** before committing:
   ```bash
   git config user.name
   git config user.email
   ```

2. **Review collaborators regularly**:
   - Check Settings ‚Üí Manage access monthly
   - Remove collaborators when projects end

3. **Enable branch protection**:
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Prevent force pushes by others

4. **Use signed commits**:
   - Set up GPG key signing
   - Verify commit authenticity

5. **Monitor repository activity**:
   - Enable notifications for all activity
   - Review commit history regularly
